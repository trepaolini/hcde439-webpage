      <h1>Tre's Assignment 1! Flashing Lights</h1>

      <p>
        As an introduction to using an Arduino, I used a breadboard and LEDs to
        make 3 lights blink.

      <h2>Schematics and Circuitry</h2>

      <p>
        I originally wanted to run all three LEDs through one series, but
        because the arduino only outputs 5 volts, it made all the LEDs end up
        very dim because they were slated to pull 5.4 volts all together. So, I
        decided to run 2 Red LEDs in series and then a separate Yellow LED in
        parallel with the 2 Red LEDS.

        Using Ohm's Law, I calculated the amount of resistance I would need for
        each circuit I would run in parallel. Both circuits needed less that 220
        Ohms or resistance, which was the lowest type of resistor I had, so I used 2 220 Ohm resistors.

      <h2> Code and Final Operation</h2>

      <p>
      After this, I needed to make the LEDs blink using Arduino code. Luckily, LED blinking is given in the arduino IDE as an example, so i easily made the LEDs work after tinkering with the code a littler bit.
      
      I ended up with some small difference from the example:

      <pre>
        /*
        My Blink
      
        Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
      
        This is mostly taken from the Arduino sample, but I changed the output pin and time between blinks
       */
      
      // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
      void setup() {
        pinMode(12, OUTPUT); // initialize digital pin 12 as an output.
      }
      
      // the loop function runs over and over again forever
      void loop() {
        digitalWrite(12, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
        delay(500);                       // wait half a second
        digitalWrite(12, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
        delay(500);                       // wait half a second
      }

      </pre>

</p>
      <p>

      Running this code through the arduino resulted in this beautiful, seasonal flashing light.
